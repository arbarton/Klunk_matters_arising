# Matters arising

This repository contains scripts for rerunning the analysis in: 

**downsample.sh** contains a number of scripts for generating the down-sampled coverage profiles created from UK10k samples and then running those through the rest of the pipeline

**Figure1_plots.md** contians the scripts to generate the density and q-q plots in figure 1. It reads in the p-values generated from the downsample.sh, run_permutations.sh.
